This is mainly a bugfix/update release, but does include the first model of a beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron.
It also marks a switch for McXtrace to the the GPLv3 license.

1. Improved installation scripts
        1. Installs cleanly on Mac silicon 
2. Updated examples:
        1. MAXIV_DanMAX_pxrd2d.instr

        1. SOLEIL ROCK beamline.
        2. ESRF BM29 skeleton beamline.
        3. Example of Air-scattering block.
        4. Test example for the GROUP langnuage feature
        5. Union demo test example
        6. New Example of Compton scattering union process.
3. Updated Components
        1. PowderN.comp: Fix bug with faulty packing factor logic, which lead to wrong intensities when used with SPLIT.
	1. Lens_parab_Cyl_rough.comp, Lens_parab_rough.comp, Lens_Kinoform.comp: documentation issues

        is to help collaboration wih the Debian project.

Keep an eye open for the forthcoming McXtrace 3.0 technology-preview that will allow GPU acceleration
using OpenACC on NVIDIA cards.

each corresponding to an energy bin.

and the _rough versions themselves retired.
